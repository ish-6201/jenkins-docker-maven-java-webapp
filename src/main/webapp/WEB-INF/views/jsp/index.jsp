<h1>Sahaja Yoga</h1>
<h2>Experience Sahaja Yoga Meditation</h2>
<p>The time has come for all of you to get your self-realisation, by which your attention becomes enlightened, your health gets completely all right, your mental processes are sensible, but above all you stand in your present.
- H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, 29.09.1994, Los Angeles, USA</p>

<p>“Sahaja” in Sanskrit means "spontaneous" and also "born with", "Yoga” means "union with God". The potential of spiritual awakening and ascent is within every human being in the form of Kundalini. The Kundalini can be awakened through a unique living process of Sahaja Yoga called Self Realisation.</p>
<h1>You Can Not Pay For Your Self-Realisation</h1>
<p>"So one should understand that you are not to pay for this. You are not to pay for what I say to you, or for my lectures, or anything, or for your Realisation, not at all, not a single pie for that. You cannot pay for it. It is so invaluable. ... It is absolutely overflowing. It's absolutely freely coming to you. So you cannot pay for your Self-Realisation. It's Love, and Love, you cannot purchase."
- H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, London, 1982 </p>
